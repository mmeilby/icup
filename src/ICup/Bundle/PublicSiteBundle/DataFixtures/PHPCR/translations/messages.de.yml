    price:
        title: How much does it cost to participate?
        body: >
            <p>The participation cost depends on several things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Will you arrive with bus or airplane?</li>
                <li>How do you expect to stay - in tent, on public school or at hotel?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you travel from a european country you should expect expenses for about € 500 covering transport and tournament fee.
                This also covers the expense for staying at a public school or on camping at the beach.
            </p>
            <p>
                Depending on how much you drink and eat you should be able to eat out every day using less than € 20 each day.
                But don't forget the breakfast if you are used to that. Anyway, a simple bread from the local baker may be sufficient for you.

    firsttime:
        title: First time in Teramo?
        body: >
            <p>If this is your first time to Teramo you should be excited!</p>
            <p>
                Maybe you have a lot of questions and you may find some answers here.
                As an official for the group you should visit the tournament office as soon as you arrive to Teramo.
                From the office you will be guided to your accomodation and you will receive a box of information covering anything you need to know
                about the Interamnia World Cup and Teramo.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tournament office you will find just behind the main square Piazza Martiri della Libertà.
                Look for the street Via Nico Palma at Corso Cerulli.

    advices:
        title: A simple advice
        body: >
            <p>The Interamnia World Cup is played in Teramo - a cosy city with an ancient core easy to overlook and find your way within.</p>
            <p>Players can walk on their own - maybe to dine at one of the nice restaurants - and then later return to the main square at Campo 1.</p>
            <p>However it is advisable to agree on some simple rules.</p>
            <p>Some teams use a set of rules common for all activities with the club - others - have no polices for summer camps in Italy.</p>
            <p>In general, when players walk in small groups everything work out fine.</p>
    matches:
        title: How many matches will I play?
        body: >
            <p>
                Usually the groups are assigned six teams.
                So in most cases the team will play at least five matches.
                Should the team qualify for elimination rounds even more matches will be played.
            </p>
            <p>
                A team that does not qualify and wants to play more matches should try to arrange friendly matches.
                Ask the tournament office for help to arrange these matches. They will arrange the playground and referees as well.
