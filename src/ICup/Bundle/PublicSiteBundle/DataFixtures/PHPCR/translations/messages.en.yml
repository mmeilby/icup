            <p>
            In view of the next tournament, even in consideration of the great number of clubs of various countries wanting to participate, we are reinvigorating
            the event in all its contents and giving more attention to all those logistic aspects which have lately been overlooked.
            We are also taking advantage of the precious support offered by a new and important partner of ours, the University of Teramo, with whom we have made a cooperation agreement.
            </p>

            Within the ongoing cooperation between the University of Teramo and the Interamnia World Cup,

            <p>
            <strong>Category B and H (over 18 male and female teams)</strong><br />
            These categories have been part of the tournament in the past four years, as a suggestion made by some clubs
            who were particularly fond of the tournament. Such categories give the opportunity to those male and female
            athletes who have participated in previous years and still want to participate despite having gone
            over the age of 18 (born in 1997 and before).

    intro:
        title: The Interamnia World Cup for the 43rd time
        body: >
            <p>
                Interamnia - means between rivers - and refers to the position of Teramo, surrounded by the rivers Tordino og Vezzola.
                In the streets of this beautyfull classic italian city, the 43rd edition of the great tournament known as the unofficial world championsship
                for young people will take place this summer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since 1973 this event has been ongoing every summer creating an amazing experience for girls and boys in the age of 12-18 years.
                And should you be one of those kids wanting to go back even though you have passed 18 - don't worry - now the tournament is open
                for senior teams as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tournament makes a perfect place for team building and offers a lot of great experiences with new friends from forreign countries
                in the lovely italian city life. This handball event has evolved during the last 42 years and is today a multi cultural event
                for young people from all over the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accomodated at public schools, playing in the streets and on city squares - it all tributes to a better understanding and respect
                of other young people no matter where they come from, no matter what color or relegion they have.
            </p>
    price:
        title: How much does it cost to participate?
        body: >
            <p>The participation cost depends on several things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Will you arrive with bus or airplane?</li>
                <li>How do you expect to stay - in tent, on public school or at hotel?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you travel from a european country you should expect expenses for about € 500 covering transport and tournament fee.
                This also covers the expense for staying at a public school or on camping at the beach.
            </p>
            <p>
                Depending on how much you drink and eat you should be able to eat out every day using less than € 20 each day.
                But don't forget the breakfast if you are used to that. Anyway, a simple bread from the local baker may be sufficient for you.
            </p>
    firsttime:
        title: First time in Teramo?
        body: >
            <p>If this is your first time to Teramo you should be excited!</p>
            <p>
                Maybe you have a lot of questions and you may find some answers here.
                As an official for the group you should visit the tournament office as soon as you arrive to Teramo.
                From the office you will be guided to your accomodation and you will receive a box of information covering anything you need to know
                about the Interamnia World Cup and Teramo.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tournament office you will find just behind the main square Piazza Martiri della Libertà.
                Look for the street Via Nico Palma at Corso Cerulli.
            </p>
    advices:
        title: A simple advice
        body: >
            <p>The Interamnia World Cup is played in Teramo - a cosy city with an ancient core easy to overlook and find your way within.</p>
            <p>Players can walk on their own - maybe to dine at one of the nice restaurants - and then later return to the main square at Campo 1.</p>
            <p>However it is advisable to agree on some simple rules.</p>
            <p>Some teams use a set of rules common for all activities with the club - others - have no polices for summer camps in Italy.</p>
            <p>In general, when players walk in small groups everything work out fine.</p>
    matches:
        title: How many matches will I play?
        body: >
            <p>
                Usually the groups are assigned six teams.
                So in most cases the team will play at least five matches.
                Should the team qualify for elimination rounds even more matches will be played.
            </p>
            <p>
                A team that does not qualify and wants to play more matches should try to arrange friendly matches.
                Ask the tournament office for help to arrange these matches. They will arrange the playground and referees as well.
